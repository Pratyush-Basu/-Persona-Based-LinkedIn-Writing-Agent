Time wasted that could be better spent working. So when I started up again, I decided not to have calls unless absolutely necessary. Every Monday, the team connects for company updates. Everything else happens async — through email and tools like Asana. When we do have a call, it’s done in 15 minutes, leaving time for banter and fun! The principle is simple: plan well, respect everyone’s time, and document everything. That’s how we protect what truly matters — our focus."

The mentor should NOT be much older than you.\n\nWhen 20-year-olds write to me requesting for me to become their mentor, I have a facepalm moment.\nI will make a horrible mentor to a 20-year-old.\nBecause things that are obvious to me are things the other person would not have even experienced (for no fault of theirs).\n\nWhat you want is a mentor who is 5-10 years older than you.\nSo that they offer a relatable perspective.\n\n3. The mentor should NOT think like you.\n\nIf they do, you will get the same answers that you too would have come up with.\nThe mentor needs to challenge your thinking; ask you questions to push you in a new direction that you could explore.\n\nSecond — once you identify who that person can be, simply ask:\n\n- Send cold emails\n- Request them for an hour a month\n- Be clear about what you want from them in that hour, and update them on your progress.\n\nAs long as you are not looking for a celebrity as your mentor, you will be surprised by how many people will find the time and space to help you."

So I recorded every hour of my day; I did this for 13 years. Just this act of measurement led to the act of improvement. Do it for 10 days and you will see the difference.\n\n2) Time blocking\nI realised context switching was taking a toll. I started blocking 2-3 hours and have been doing so till date. Monday AM: X, Monday PM: Y, Tuesday all day: Z\n\n3) Win the week, not the day\nThink of your week as your time unit, not your day. Think of what you wish to achieve in a week and split your week to achieve that.\n\n4) Single source of action\nWe are constantly being fed a to-do list from multiple sources. What helps me is to have a single source of action - my emails. It can be a to-do app for you, a notebook, or post-its - anything except your memory.\n\n5) Create repeatable tasks\nI am a student of processes. So my endeavour is - find something I need to do in life, and find a way to convert it into a recurring task which I can add to my calendar. It builds a habit, routine, and discipline for your mind.\n\n6) Setup distraction time\nOur mind craves distraction because we make it a forbidden fruit. Do the opposite. Set up time to waste time.\n\n7) Zoom out\nWe struggle to manage time because we look at it in a micro way. Go back to the macro. What do you want to achieve this month, quarter, or year? What are the big milestones that will get you there (or tell you that you are on the path)? Did that happen this week? If yes - great. If not - go back to step 1 and figure out what went wrong. Repeat every week."

  "post": "I used to think getting rich was about how much you earn. Until I read The Psychology of Money, and these 5 lessons changed my mindset:\n\n1. Being rich is NOT being wealthy. Whenever you go to someone's lavish house, you will always think: 'Wow! What a magnificent & spacious house.' Never: 'Wow! What a massive loan they might have on their head.' We think being rich = things people have that we can see. Being wealthy means you earn without spending your time.\n\n2. Controlling your time is the biggest wealth. If you are earning money for the sake of earning money & spending it on lavish things, you're running on a lifelong treadmill. But if you earn money with the motivation of buying more time, That will be the true value of money. That will set you free.\n\n3. Generate luck as a discipline in life. Let's say you write 100 cold emails per day, for a freelance gig. Let's assume that you get 5 replies out of 100. In this case, you're increasing your odds of getting lucky everyday. Because one day, there will be a reply which can change your life.\n\n4. Compounding is the 8th wonder of the world. Small changes in one direction make a huge difference over a long period of time. This is not just for your investments. It also applies to organisations, relationships, and personal abilities.\n\n5. Money is not important if you can't sleep at night. What's the point of having crores in your bank, if you are not able to sleep? Or what's the point of investing in risky instruments that keep you up at night? No amount of money is worth more than your sleep."

Your nights, weekends, holidays — whatever you can manage. Explore different things that you feel you could be good at.\n\nMost of us do it wrong: We quit our jobs.

Don’t take it personally.\nCompanies have certain criteria (skillset or cultural fit) while looking for hires, and they hold no personal grudge against you.\n\n2. Write a thank you email.\nNo agenda. Simply being grateful for what you learnt and thanking the hiring manager for their time. This small act makes you stand out — very few candidates do it.\n\n3. Ask for feedback.\nIf you want to learn from the experience, seek permission for feedback. Do it a few days later, not immediately after the rejection.\nImmediately = you look desperate for the job.\nLater = you look like someone genuinely committed to growth.\n\n4. Reflect on the process yourself.\nNote down:\n- What questions did you struggle with?\n- Where did your confidence dip?\n- Which answers could you refine for next time?\n\nRejections hurt — but if you look beyond the “no”, you learn something that brings you closer to the “yes.”"

The world changes.\n\nWhat matters more is adaptability.\n\n3 ways to build adaptability:\n\n- Question assumptions\n\nDon’t just accept “this is how it’s always done.” Ask what’s changed and what could be done differently.\n\n- Experiment small, adjust fast\n\nRun quick tests instead of big bets. Adaptation is easier when the cost of failure is low.\n\n- Watch patterns, not events\n\nOne failure or success doesn’t tell the whole story. Look for trends before you decide how to adjust.\n\nThe real test comes when we are forced out of our comfort zones.\n\nWhen the job we thought we’d stay in forever disappears. When the skills we worked so hard to learn become outdated. When the life plan we once imagined no longer makes sense.\n\nIn those moments, the smartest person in the room is not the one who knows the most.\n\nIt is the one who adapts the fastest.\n\nPS: If you found this helpful, I share more insights to help you build the right mindset."

What can I try next?\n\nThe mind is powerful and programmable.\nUse it wisely."

Measure your progress by inputs, not outcome\nYou can’t control the outcome. But you can control your inputs.\nAnd that’s what you need to feel in control.\n\n2. 2-minute rule\nMake it ridiculously easy for you to keep doing it - especially on the days you don’t feel like it.\nDo it for 2 minutes every day, until you start getting used to it.\n\n3. Temptation bundling\nBundle what you like to do and what you want to do as part of a routine.\nFor example: You like watching YouTube, but you want to have an upskill routine.\nSo, you could watch your course content on YouTube — tutorials, discussions, animations, etc.\n\n4. Habit stacking (from Atomic Habits)\nCombine the new activity you want to incorporate before or after an existing habit.\nThis way, there’s less friction and it blends into your routine.\n\n5. What if?\nClose your eyes and visualise what will happen if you are unable to pursue this.\nMore importantly, if you do – how will it change your life?\n\nThe only thing that makes humans feel alive is a sense of action.\nNot overthinking!\n\nPS: If you found this helpful, I share more insights to help you build the life you dream of."
